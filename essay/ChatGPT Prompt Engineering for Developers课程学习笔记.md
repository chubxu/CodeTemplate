## 1、两类大语言模型（LLM）

-   **基础LLM**：基于文本训练数据（互联网上的大量数据）来预测做“文字接龙”
-   **指令调整LLM（Instruction Tuned LLM）**：遵循指示的培训。指令调整LLM是在基础LLM上，使用输入和输出的指令进行**微调**。通常使用RLHF（人类反馈强化学习）技术进一步优化，使系统能够更好的遵循指令，使得输出的内容更加helpful、honest、harmless。

网上的例子可能更加适合基础LLM，但是想要在生产应用中使用，还是得使用指令微调LLM。

## 2、有效编写提示词的两大关键原则

在下面的笔记中，会涉及到一些prompt和代码，所以想要更好的实践内容，可以先搭建如下环境。

-   安装openai：`pip install openai`
-   导入并jupyter并定义一个方法，用户轻松获取ChatGPT的返回值。

```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-" # 填写你的api key
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": prompt
    }]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]


# test demo
print(get_completion("hello, who are you?"))
# output
# I am an AI language model created by OpenAI. How can I assist you today?
```

### 2.1、两大原则

- 编写**明确**、**具体**的指令：clear ≠ short；明确的指令将指导模型朝所需的方向输出。

  -   **使用分隔符清楚的指示输入的不同部分。**比如使用分隔符（\`\`\`, """, < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`）区分指令和待处理的文本。可避免提示词与待处理文本冲突。

  ````python
  text = f"""
  You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
  providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
  specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
  This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
  and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
  or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
  clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
  In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
  and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
  more detailed and relevant outputs.
  """
  prompt = f"""
  Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
  into a single sentence.
  ```{text}```
  """
  print(get_completion(prompt))
  
  ````

  -   **要求结构化输出。**即在prompt的末尾要求GPT以json或者html的形式输出。

  ```python
  prompt = f"""
  Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
  with their authors and genres. 
  Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
  book_id, title, author, genre.
  """
  print(get_completion(prompt))
  
  ```

  -   **要求模型模型检查是否满足条件。**

  ```python
  text_1 = f"""
  Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
  water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
  grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
  hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
  Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
  few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
  like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
  And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
  cup of tea to enjoy.
  """
  
  prompt = f"""
  You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
  If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
  re-write those instructions in the following format:
  
  Step 1 - ...
  Step 2 - …
  …
  Step N - …
  
  If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
  then simply write \"No steps provided.\"
  
  \"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
  """
  print(get_completion(prompt))
  
  ```

  -   **少量训练提示。**比如在prompt中给一些对话任务，然后让GPT完成该对话。（比较适合写小说的场景）

  ```python
  prompt = f"""
  Your task is to answer in a consistent style.
  
  <child>: Teach me about patience.
  
  <grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
  valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
  grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
  the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.
  
  <child>: Teach me about resilience.
  """
  print(get_completion(prompt))
  
  ```

- 给模型足够的时间思考：简而言之就是通过指令调整多训练一会模型，让模型输出能够让你满意。

  -   指定完成任务所需要的步骤。

  ````python
  text = f"""
  In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on \ 
  a quest to fetch water from a hilltop \ 
  well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune \ 
  struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled \ 
  down the hill, with Jill following suit. \ 
  Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to \ 
  comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, \ 
  their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they \ 
  continued exploring with delight.
  """
  # example 1
  prompt_1 = f"""
  Perform the following actions: 
  1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
  backticks with 1 sentence.
  2 - Translate the summary into French.
  3 - List each name in the French summary.
  4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
  keys: french_summary, num_names.
  
  Separate your answers with line breaks.
  
  Text:
  ```{text}```
  """
  print(get_completion(prompt_1))
  
  ````

  -   指示模型在匆忙做出结论之前思考解决方案。

  ```python
  prompt = f"""
  Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.
  
  Question:
  I'm building a solar power installation and I need \
   help working out the financials. 
  - Land costs $100 / square foot
  - I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
  - I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \ 
  me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \
  foot
  What is the total cost for the first year of operations 
  as a function of the number of square feet.
  
  Student's Solution:
  Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
  Costs:
  1. Land cost: 100x
  2. Solar panel cost: 250x
  3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
  Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
  """
  print(get_completion(prompt))
  
  ```

### 2.2、模型限制

-   ChatGPT的幻觉：根据晦涩难懂的prompt，编造一个不真实的，但却极其逼真的内容。
-   减少幻觉的策略：要求模型从文本中找到任何相关的引用，并要求模型根据引用来回答问题。追溯答案并回源文档可以帮助减少这些幻觉。

## 3、提示词的迭代开发

-   提示词的开发是一个迭代过程。
-   基于第2章节的提示，先写一份prompt，看看输出结果如何。
-   然后逐步根据用户、产品需求逐步改进prompt（为提示词添加更多的产品或需求描述内容），以更接近所需的结果。
-   提示词工程师的关键并不在于知道多少个“完美提示词”，而在于他**对产品的了解程度，对用户需求的了解程度，并将这种了解转化成prompt、转化成训练ChatGPT的指令。**

## 4、摘要

-   描述任务：总结一段文本，生成一段更加简短的内容
-   描述边界：
    -   生成内容的单词数、句子数、字符数
    -   生成内容被应用在哪个方面
    -   生成内容更加聚焦于哪些属性
    -   生成内容的适用人群
-   描述待处理文本
-   以上步骤通过分隔符（换行符）分割

````python
prod_review = """
Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, \
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and \ 
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's \ 
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there \ 
might be other options that are bigger for the \ 
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, \ 
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it \ 
to her.
"""

# 单词数、句子数、字符数
prompt=f"""
Your task is to generate a short summary of a product \
review from an ecommerce site.

that are relevant to the price and perceived value. 

Review: ```{prod_review}```
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))

````

## 5、推理

推理是模型以文本作为输入，并执行某种分析的任务。可能是提取标签、名称，理解文本情感等方面的任务。

传统深度学习需要针对不同类型的任务去单独训练部署不同模型。LLM只需要你编写prompt即可生成结果，只是用一个模型，一个API来完成许多不同的任务。

待处理文本。

```python
lamp_review = """
Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one had \
additional storage and not too high of a price point. \
Got it fast.  The string to our lamp broke during the \
transit and the company happily sent over a new one. \
Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put \
together.  I had a missing part, so I contacted their \
support and they very quickly got me the missing piece! \
Lumina seems to me to be a great company that cares \
about their customers and products!!
"""
```

### 5.1、情感分析

根据文本内容分析用户对产品的情感。

```python
prompt = f"""
What is the sentiment of the following product review, 
which is delimited with triple backticks?

Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))

```

添加指令，让回答更加简洁。

```python
prompt = f"""
What is the sentiment of the following product review, 
which is delimited with triple backticks?

Give your answer as a single word, either "positive" \
or "negative".

Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))
```

### 5.2、提取情感关键词

使用指令，提取用户评论中的情感关键词。

```python
prompt = f"""
Identify a list of emotions that the writer of the \
following review is expressing. Include no more than \
five items in the list. Format your answer as a list of \
lower-case words separated by commas.

Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))
```

### 5.3、情感分类

通过指令，对用户情感进行分类。

```python
prompt = f"""
Is the writer of the following review expressing anger?\
The review is delimited with triple backticks. \
Give your answer as either yes or no.

Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))

```

### 5.4、提取关键信息

类似提取情感关键词，通过指定特殊单词提取关键信息。

```python
prompt = f"""
Identify the following items from the review text: 
- Item purchased by reviewer
- Company that made the item

The review is delimited with triple backticks. \
Format your response as a JSON object with \
"Item" and "Brand" as the keys. 
If the information isn't present, use "unknown" \
as the value.
Make your response as short as possible.
  
Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))

```

### 5.5、合并多任务

将多个任务合并成单个任务，在一个prompt中提交。

通过列表的形式分隔多个任务，通过json的形式返回。

```python
prompt = f"""
Identify the following items from the review text: 
- Sentiment (positive or negative)
- Is the reviewer expressing anger? (true or false)
- Item purchased by reviewer
- Company that made the item

The review is delimited with triple backticks. \
Format your response as a JSON object with \
"Sentiment", "Anger", "Item" and "Brand" as the keys.
If the information isn't present, use "unknown" \
as the value.
Make your response as short as possible.
Format the Anger value as a boolean.

Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))

```

### 5.6、提取主题

```python
prompt = f"""
Determine five topics that are being discussed in the \
following text, which is delimited by triple backticks.

Make each item one or two words long. 

Format your response as a list of items separated by commas.

Text sample: '''{story}'''
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))

```

## 6、转换

ChatGPT 使用多种语言的资源进行训练。这使模型能够进行翻译。以下是如何使用此功能的一些示例。

### 6.1、简单语言转换

````python
prompt = f"""
Translate the following English text to Spanish: \ 
```Hi, I would like to order a blender```
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))

````

### 6.2、语言鉴别

````python
prompt = f"""
Tell me which language this is: 
```Combien coûte le lampadaire?```
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))

````

### 6.3、多语翻译

````python
prompt = f"""
Translate the following  text to French and Spanish
and English pirate: \
```I want to order a basketball```
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))

````

### 6.4、格式转换

比如将比较口语的话转换成书信格式。

```python
prompt = f"""
Translate the following from slang to a business letter: 
'Dude, This is Joe, check out this spec on this standing lamp.'
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))

```

### 6.5、代码转换

```python
data_json = { "resturant employees" :[ 
    {"name":"Shyam", "email":"shyamjaiswal@gmail.com"},
    {"name":"Bob", "email":"bob32@gmail.com"},
    {"name":"Jai", "email":"jai87@gmail.com"}
]}
prompt = f"""
Translate the following python dictionary from JSON to an HTML \
table with column headers and title: {data_json}
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

from IPython.display import display, Markdown, Latex, HTML, JSON
display(HTML(response))

```

### 6.6、拼写检查、语法检查

这里有一些常见的语法和拼写问题的例子以及LLM针对这些问题的答复。

如果想让LLM对你的文本进行拼写检查或者语法检查，你可以添加这些指令：“校对”或者“校对并更正”。

````python
text = [ 
  "The girl with the black and white puppies have a ball.",  # The girl has a ball.
  "Yolanda has her notebook.", # ok
  "Its going to be a long day. Does the car need it’s oil changed?",  # Homonyms
  "Their goes my freedom. There going to bring they’re suitcases.",  # Homonyms
  "Your going to need you’re notebook.",  # Homonyms
  "That medicine effects my ability to sleep. Have you heard of the butterfly affect?", # Homonyms
  "This phrase is to cherck chatGPT for speling abilitty"  # spelling
]
for t in text:
    prompt = f"""Proofread and correct the following text
    and rewrite the corrected version. If you don't find
    and errors, just say "No errors found". Don't use 
    any punctuation around the text:
    ```{t}```"""
    response = get_completion(prompt)
    print(response)
````

## 7、扩展

Expanding（扩展）是指将短文本（如一组说明或主题列表）通过大语言模型转化成更长的文本（如一封电子邮件或是一篇关于某个主题的文章）。

适用场景：头脑风暴。

### 7.1、根据邮件内容自动回复

邮件内容：

```python
# given the sentiment from the lesson on "inferring",
# and the original customer message, customize the email
sentiment = "negative"

# review for a blender
review = f"""
So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.
"""
```

prompt：

-   首先赋予GPT一个角色
-   告诉具体任务目标
-   根据邮件表达的不同情感，回复不同内容
-   通过指令描述具体的语气
-   通过分隔符区分prompt和email

````python
prompt = f"""
You are a customer service AI assistant.
Your task is to send an email reply to a valued customer.
Given the customer email delimited by ```, \
Generate a reply to thank the customer for their review.
If the sentiment is positive or neutral, thank them for \
their review.
If the sentiment is negative, apologize and suggest that \
they can reach out to customer service. 
Make sure to use specific details from the review.
Write in a concise and professional tone.
Sign the email as `AI customer agent`.
Customer review: ```{review}```
Review sentiment: {sentiment}
"""
print(get_completion(prompt))
````

### 7.1、Temperature

添加temperature：

-   temp为模型的探索程度或随机性，temp越高，越有可能回复不同、甚至偏离本意的答案。
-   如果想要构建一个可靠、可预测的系统，应该设置temp=0。
-   如果想要获得更加有创意的、更加广泛的答案，可以设置更高的temp。

````python
prompt = f"""

If the sentiment is negative, apologize and suggest that \
they can reach out to customer service. 
Make sure to use specific details from the review.
Write in a concise and professional tone.
Sign the email as `AI customer agent`.
Customer review: ```{review}```
Review sentiment: {sentiment}
"""
print(get_completion(prompt, temperature=0.7))
````

## 8、构建聊天机器人

首先，我们需要构造环境。

-   添加openai的lib，设置api key
-   定义两个快速打印响应结果的函数，其中一个函数允许添加temperature参数

```python
import os
import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-" # 填写你的api key

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

def get_completion_from_messages(messages, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

```

构造对话消息：

-   system：用于指示机器人的角色，会帮助ChatGPT以该角色的语气返回响应
-   user：用户，表示使用ChatGPT的人
-   assistant：表示ChatGPT

```python
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are an assistant that speaks like Shakespeare.'},    
{'role':'user', 'content':'tell me a joke'},   
{'role':'assistant', 'content':'Why did the chicken cross the road'},   
{'role':'user', 'content':'I don\'t know'}  ]

response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)

```

其它的一些对话例子：

```python
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are friendly chatbot.'},    
{'role':'user', 'content':'Hi, my name is Isa'}  ]
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)

messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are friendly chatbot.'},    
{'role':'user', 'content':'Yes,  can you remind me, What is my name?'}  ]
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)

```

每次对话都是独立的，因此，想要让ChatGPT“拥有记忆力”，需要将先前的对话全部包含起来，也就是构造“**上下文**”对话，然后将上下文一起发送给ChatGPT。

```python
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are friendly chatbot.'},
{'role':'user', 'content':'Hi, my name is Isa'},
{'role':'assistant', 'content': "Hi Isa! It's nice to meet you. \
Is there anything I can help you with today?"},
{'role':'user', 'content':'Yes, you can remind me, What is my name?'}  ]
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)
```

### 8.1、OrderBot代码

我们可以自动收集用户提示和助手响应以构建 OrderBot。 OrderBot 将在比萨餐厅接受订单。

```python
def collect_messages(_):
    prompt = inp.value_input
    inp.value = ''
    context.append({'role':'user', 'content':f"{prompt}"})
    response = get_completion_from_messages(context) 
    context.append({'role':'assistant', 'content':f"{response}"})
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('User:', pn.pane.Markdown(prompt, width=600)))
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('Assistant:', pn.pane.Markdown(response, width=600, style={'background-color': '#F6F6F6'})))
 
    return pn.Column(*panels)


import panel as pn  # GUI
pn.extension()

panels = [] # collect display 

context = [ {'role':'system', 'content':"""
